My app does not work right now. I could not replicate the app that you showed on youtube. I am a terrible coder and should be executed by firing squad. Lol jk i used a lot of the bird watchign app from the apple development site to help me with alot of the coding and setting of the task fields. I also used the interwebz to find how to use the edit button and attempt to make the strikethrough. I used an NSAtrributableMutable string so that i can give it attributes when i touch it. The coding does not work for that i did not finish that part. I also didnt get the save files to work with your dictionary and without your dictionary.
